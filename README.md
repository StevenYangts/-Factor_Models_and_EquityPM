**Project Overview**
This project focuses on the factor exposure analysis of individual securities and portfolios, employing both static and rolling regression techniques using the Fama-French 3-Factor Model and the Carhart 4-Factor Model. Additionally, the project extends these multi-factor models to equity portfolio management.

**Key Features**
1. Factor Exposure Analysis

Explore both static and rolling factor exposure of various securities using:

Fama-French 3-Factor Model

Carhart 4-Factor Model

2. Equity Portfolio Management

Functions developed to generate equity portfolios for given stock tickers and their corresponding weights.
Portfolio Factor Exposure: Calculate the overall factor exposure of a portfolio based on the factor loadings of individual stocks.
Risk Decomposition: Decompose portfolio risk into:
Common Factor Variance
Specific (Idiosyncratic) Variance

3. Performance and Risk Metrics

The project includes basic functions to calculate portfolio-level performance and risk metrics, such as:

Sharpe Ratio<br>
Sortino Ratio<br>
Calmar Ratio<br>
Max Drawdown<br>
Parametric VaR<br>
Parametric CVaR<br>
Historical VaR<br>
Historical CVaR<br>
